## Abstract

The aim of this project is to enable RF based non-invasive monitoring of an individual's respiratory rate. The system is designed around the Pluto SDR (Analog Devices) - controlled using GNU Radio. We transmit a 2.4 GHz signal (Wifi band), which passes through an individual's body, and is received by a receiver at the other end. We aim to study the baseband I and Q signals - applying both machine learning and signal processing based approaches to the collected data, to accurately estimate respiratory rate from the recieved signal. This approach can potentially enable passive respiratory rate monitoring of individals at homes/offices which is invaluable in COVID-19 monitoring. It can also be expanded to social distancing/localization applications.
